# Problem Statement

Modern healthcare systems focus mainly on treatment rather than prevention. Many individuals ignore early symptoms such as fatigue, poor sleep, dehydration, or stress until the condition becomes severe. Additionally, consulting healthcare professionals for minor lifestyle concerns is often expensive and time-consuming.

Digital health apps exist, but they typically suffer from one or more limitations:

* They provide generic advice instead of personalized guidance
* They do not consider past medical history
* They do not interpret symptoms intelligently
* They are expensive to scale due to high AI processing cost

At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) can analyze health information effectively, but sending long medical histories directly to such models increases computational cost due to high token usage.

Therefore, there is a need for a system that:

1. Analyzes wellness and lifestyle data
2. Considers medical history
3. Generates personalized preventive recommendations
4. Reduces AI processing cost

MedAgent AI addresses this problem by acting as a preventive healthcare monitoring agent that compresses health information before AI analysis, enabling affordable and scalable personalized wellness guidance.
