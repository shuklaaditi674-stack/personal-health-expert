# Cost Optimization Strategy

Large Language Models charge based on token usage. Sending large medical histories increases cost significantly.

MedAgent AI reduces cost using multiple strategies.

## 1. Medical History Compression

Medical text is summarized before analysis, reducing input tokens.

## 2. Prompt Engineering

The prompt is designed to request structured and concise output.

## 3. Caching

If similar user data appears again, previous AI responses are reused.

## 4. Structured Inputs

Instead of sending long paragraphs, the system sends categorized data fields.

## Result

The system achieves lower computational cost while maintaining useful recommendations, making the solution scalable for real-world deployment.
