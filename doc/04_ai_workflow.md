# AI Workflow

The intelligence of MedAgent AI is implemented in the Python AI Engine.

## Stage 1: Pre-processing

User data is cleaned and structured.

## Stage 2: Medical History Summarization

Long text medical history is summarized using a prompt-based compression technique.

## Stage 3: Health Analysis

The system evaluates:

* sleep patterns
* stress levels
* activity level
* past diseases
* symptoms

## Stage 4: Recommendation Generation

The AI generates safe lifestyle guidance including:

* diet improvements
* hydration
* sleep habits
* physical activity

The system explicitly avoids medical diagnosis.

## Stage 5: Structured Output

The AI produces JSON output which is returned to the backend.
